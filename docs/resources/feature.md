# rancher2\_feature Resource

Provides a Rancher v2 Feature resource. This can be used to enable/disable [experimental features](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/resources/feature-flags/) for Rancher v2 environments.

Experimental features already exist at Rancher v2.5.x systems, so they can just be updated: 
* On create, provider will read Feature from Rancher and update its value. It will return an error if feature doesn't exist
* On destroy, provider will not delete feature from Rancher, just from tfstate

**Note** Some Rancher features as `fleet`, may force a Rancher reboot once updated. The provider will wait until Rancher is rebooted. If you are modifying more than one feature in a row, and any of them requires a Rancher reboot, `terraform apply` may fail on first run. Run `terraform apply` again should work fine.  

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create a new rancher2 Feature
resource "rancher2_feature" "fleet" {
  name = "fleet"
  value = "<VALUE>"
}
```
